how to use help in vim
:h fold
Suppose you have created several folds, and now want to view all the text.
You could go to each fold and type "zo".  To do this faster, use this command:

        zr

        This will R-educe the folding.  The opposite is:

        zm

        This folds M-ore.  You can repeat "zr" and "zm" to open and close nested folds
        of several levels.
use gg command to go to the bottom of the manual
find use_28.txt in the window
move cursor to usr_28.txt
press ctrl+] to go to usr_28.txt

:ptag 函数名
p is short for preview
:pta[g][!] [tagname]                                                                                                       
                Does ":tag[!] [tagname]" and shows the found tag in a
                "Preview" window without changing the current buffer or cursor
                position.  If a "Preview" window already exists, it is re-used
                (like a help window is).  If a new one is opened,
                'previewheight' is used for the height of the window.   See
                also :tag.
